This is a collection of functions that implement the method [Three-Step Latent Vector Autoregression (Rein, Vermunt, De Roover, Vogelsmeier, 2023)](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/a2muk) in R. The script `installation.R` provides some code to install or load the functions. See the file `Instructions.docx` for more information on how to load and use the functions. The related publication also provides an application example of the method using these functions.

The `Simulation` folder contains the files for the simulation in the related publication. The `examples` folder contains some (simulated) data that can be used to test the functions.
